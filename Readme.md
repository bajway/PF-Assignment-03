So, the main problems that i faced during the solution of this assignment was I had to deal with alot of structures in the last three to four questions
not just simple structures but it was sort of mind boggling when i dealt with 3D pointer memory allocation that was a whole lot of challenge, but the good thing is
after encountering such questions i'm confident enough to tackle problems related structures and DMA all in all it was great experiance
